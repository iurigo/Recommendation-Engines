A recommender system or a recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" that a user would give to an item.

Recommender systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, and are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. There are also recommender systems for experts, collaborators, jokes, restaurants, garments, financial services, life insurance, romantic partners (online dating), and Twitter pages.

Recommender systems typically produce a list of recommendations in one of two ways â€“ through collaborative and content-based filtering or the personality-based approach. Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from a user's past behaviour (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in.[8] Content-based filtering approaches utilize a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties. These approaches are often combined (see Hybrid Recommender Systems).
